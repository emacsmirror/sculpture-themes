* Sculpture

A Vivid theme for Emacs, inspired by the colors attributed to Greco-Roman Sculptures.

#+HTML: <img src="images/swatch1.gif" align="center">

Monospace fonts are boring -- use variable pitch when it doesn't break indentation / flow.

Readability is second to following a theme.  Being striking is better than being bland and useful, because attention span on dense text improves with colors (complexity decreases with categorization).
