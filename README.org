* Sculpture

A Vivid theme for Emacs, inspired by the colors attributed to Greco-Roman Sculptures.

Monospace fonts are boring -- use variable pitch when it doesn't break indentation / flow.

Readability is second to following a theme.  Being striking is better than being bland and useful.

** Sculpture

Vivid colors over a completely black background.

** Sculpture-light

Sculpture's dark version, but with the foreground and background switched.  Two colors modified for readability.
